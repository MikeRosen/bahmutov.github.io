        <h3>Today</h3>

<p>I am a software engineer interested in front and back end development, especially in using JavaScript (and its flavors) across the entire stack.
I work at <a href="http://www.utest.com/">uTest</a>, making the world a better place. I try to <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/">blog</a>
on topics related to software craft.
</p>

<p>In my spare time I built some cool stuff; it is always being improved, see the latest <a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/status/">project stats</a>.
</p>

<em>for everyone:</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/slides-now/">slides-now</a> is a stand alone slide presentation viewer
implemented inside the browser without any server side components. Just drag and drop a Markdown (.md) file
into the website page and it will play a stylish HTML5 presentation. I love the simplicity of editing my talks
as pure text files, keeping versions using Git and playing them whenever I need without logging in / uploading / etc.
It even works when I am offline, because the website is so simple it works from cache.
<p>
Alternatively, there is Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slides-now/hcohekeghgkdeimnjfmpdlgccfamggac">extension</a>
and a stand alone Node <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/slides-now-node">module</a> if you prefer.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://readonpaper.com/">read on paper</a> is the simplest way to send readable article from PC to your tablet for easier reading. It saves your eyes and trees!</li>
<li>Command line <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/boggle">Boggle</a> solver.</li>
</ul>

<em>open source tools for developers:</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/dirty-water">dirty-water</a> is CLI tool measuring
how much JavaScript is in your EJS / AngularJs templates. One should not mix
js with html, or css with html, or generate html in js. Or drink dirty water.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/deps-ok">deps-ok</a> quickly checks if any of the top level dependencies
are missing or out of date. Faster than using <code>npm ls</code>.
I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-deps-ok">grunt-deps-ok</a> grunt plugin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-nice-package">grunt-nice-package</a> is an opinionated <i>package.json</i> validator.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-npm2bower-sync">grunt-npm2bower-sync</a> is a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/grunt-sync-pkg">another project</a> that copies main properties from <i>package.json</i> to <i>bower.json</i></li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/changed">changed</a> is a command line tool that displays changes for a
given nodejs package, so you don't have to hunt manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/next-update">next-update</a> is a stand alone nodejs tool that can check
if upgrading your module's dependencies to newer versions breaks any tests. Makes it a breeze to keep your module
using the latest and greatest 3rd party tools.</li>
<li>A homebrew unit testing framework <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/gt">gt</a> that follows QUnit syntax but adds better async testing and code coverage (via <a href="https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul">istanbul</a>).</li>
<li>There is static source complexity tool <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/js-complexity-viz">jsc</a> that keeps my code nice and understandable</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lasso">lasso</a> to instrument widget test pages on the fly, giving you insight into the code covered for by the unit tests. There is no setup necessary, and check out the list of unit test frameworks in the examples folder: everything just works!</li>
<li>When the number of tests grows, and you cannot wait to run them all on each code change, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/untested">untested</a>. It stores test point mappings for each JavaScript source file (generated from code coverage reported by <em>gt</em> and <em>lasso</em>), and returns which unit tests should be run for all changed files. Test your changes all the time very quickly!</li>
<li>Well documented modules with lots of API examples are easier to reuse, maintain and develop.
I wrote js API documentation tool <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/xplain">xplain</a> that takes an unusual approach of placing unit tests as examples in the API documentation. The specific test syntax is transformed into human readable format, producing documentation that looks hand-crafted, will always stay in sync with the code, and does not require any developer maintenance.</li>
<li>I automate basic sanity check for any website deployment using <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/clean-console">clean-console</a>. It loads the url using phantomjs WebKit browser and checks for any JavaScript errors. This is quick test that runs as a last step of the deployment script.
  There is <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-clean-console">grunt-clean-console</a> plugin for grunt.
</li>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/risk-map/">risk-map</a> is a cool way to visualize the entire project's code
  complexity and unit test coverage using D3 treemap layout. Shows high risk source files in a very obvious way as
  large red patches. I talk about my inspiration for the project in
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bahmutov/talks-public/raw/master/risk-map.md">this talk</a>. I am currently working
  on using <em>risk-map</em> and developer's vanity to improve software quality, see <a href="/man-behind">man-behind</a>
  prototype.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-promises">qunit-promises</a> is a QUnit plugin that makes checking promises a breeze.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-once">qunit-once</a> is a QUnit plugin adding module.setupOnce and module.teardownOnce functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-utils">npm-utils</a> is a set of promise-returning functions that run different NPM commands.</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/jshint-solid">jshint-solid</a> tells how strict your .jshintrc file is. As project matures, you should tighten the Jshint settings.
There is <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-jshint-solid">grunt-jshint-solid</a> plugin for grunt.
</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/time-promise">time-promise</a> is a functional decorator measuring time for sync or promise-returning functions.
It is among my <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/my-favorite-functional-adaptors.html">four favorite functional adaptors</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud">proud</a> collects NPM downloads for all modules authored by a developer with given username.
  One can generate a <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud-badge">proud-badge</a>, even host a simple
  <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud-connect">proud-connect</a> server or use the deployed Heroku
  <a href="http://proud.herokuapp.com/">proud.herokuapp.com</a> app.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/aged">aged</a> is tiny utility grunt helper for filtering 
files by last modified age. Allows to define separate sets of quality metrics for recently modified (fresh)
and stable files. Read why I think this is important in 
<a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/aged-to-perfection.html">Aged to Perfection</a> blog post.
</li>
</ul>

<em>front-end components:</em>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/color-pusher/">color-pusher</a> is a widget geared towards real time
    website color tweaking.
    Allows anyone to change multiple page colors, including swapping an entire external palette. I created
    <em>color-pusher</em> to give graphic designers power to tweak live websites without making a round trip to
    a developer to deploy the new color scheme. There is a Chrome DevTools 
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-pusher/gcahnlgconcbplfboahcgaobkpdhidee">panel extension</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/color-pusher-chrome">source</a>, that allows editing any live website.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/code-box/">code-box</a> is a lightbox for code blocks. Adds full screen lightbox
    to all code elements in your page with single call.
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/progress-full-width">progress-full-width</a> is a progress bar along
  the bottom of the page, can be stacked or run on a timer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/sticky-right-top-icon">sticky-right-top-icon</a> adds a sticky icon to
any element, even if it has scrollable content inside.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yesterday</h3>

<p>I worked for a year at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a>, helping to bring the power of MATLAB to the browser.</p>

<p>Earlier I spent four years as a researcher at <a href="http://www.everyscape.com/">EveryScape</a>, writing panorama stitching and 3D modeling software. Before that I worked calibrating 3D laser scanners and developing white light scanners. Even before that I wrote distributed database access software that worked across Objective-C, C and Java systems.</p>

<h3>Talks</h3>

<p>I am a member of multiple meetups in the Boston area and spoke about
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/grunt.md">grunt</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/coverage-and-tests.md">code coverage and testing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/risk-map.md">technical debt visualization</a>
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Doctorate from Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana) working with Dr. Voice Popescu (adviser) and Dr. Mihai Mudure (fellow candidate), developing a novel scanning sensor. We were building 3D models of rooms in real time using a video camera and a bunch of lasers. If you were afraid of lasers, you could be anywhere else in the world, observing the results over the internet, as our system was smart enough to incrementally update the 3D model and send the results in real time.</p>

<h3>Small print</h3>

<p>Some of my github repositories are not up to date, while I am working on cleaning up the code.</p>
