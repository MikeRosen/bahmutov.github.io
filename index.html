        <h3 id="today">Today</h3>

<p>I am a software engineer interested in front and back end development, especially in using JavaScript (and its flavors) across the entire stack.
I work at <a href="http://www.kensho.com/">Kensho</a>, making the world a better place. I try to <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/">blog</a>
on topics related to software craft.
</p>

<p>In my spare time I built some cool stuff; it is always being improved, see the latest <a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/status/">project stats</a>.
</p>

<em>for everyone:</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/2048/">2048 5x5</a> is a clone of the famous 2048 game with larger board and two new tiles
  appearing at each turn. Makes the game very fast paced. <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/2048">source</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/2048-cram/">2048-cram</a> lets you play standard 2048 but every N seconds
  pops a JavaScript question. Answer incorrectly and lose a turn, plus get a penalty tile! 
  <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/2048-cram">source</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/slides-now/">slides-now</a> is a stand alone slide presentation viewer
implemented inside the browser without any server side components. Just drag and drop a Markdown (.md) file
into the website page and it will play a stylish HTML5 presentation. I love the simplicity of editing my talks
as pure text files, keeping versions using Git and playing them whenever I need without logging in / uploading / etc.
It even works when I am offline, because the website is so simple it works from cache.
<p>
Alternatively, there is Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slides-now/hcohekeghgkdeimnjfmpdlgccfamggac">extension</a>
and a stand alone Node <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/slides-now-node">module</a> if you prefer.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://readonpaper.com/">read on paper</a> is the simplest way to send readable article from PC to your tablet for easier reading. It saves your eyes and trees!
</li>
<li>Command line <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/boggle">Boggle</a> solver.</li>
</ul>

<em>open source tools for developers:</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/d3-helpers">d3-helpers</a> are tiny functional utilities mostly to simplify
  callbacks for D3. Also could be used to chain method calls, property access and function applications anywhere.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/dirty-water">dirty-water</a> is CLI tool measuring
how much JavaScript is in your EJS / AngularJs templates. One should not mix
js with html, or css with html, or generate html in js. Or drink dirty water.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/deps-ok">deps-ok</a> quickly checks if any of the top level dependencies
are missing or out of date. Faster than using <code>npm ls</code>.
I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-deps-ok">grunt-deps-ok</a> grunt plugin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-nice-package">grunt-nice-package</a> is an opinionated <i>package.json</i> validator.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-npm2bower-sync">grunt-npm2bower-sync</a> is a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/grunt-sync-pkg">another project</a> that copies main properties from <i>package.json</i> to <i>bower.json</i></li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/changed">changed</a> is a command line tool that displays changes for a
given nodejs package, so you don't have to hunt manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/next-update">next-update</a> is a stand alone nodejs tool that can check
if upgrading your module's dependencies to newer versions breaks any tests. Makes it a breeze to keep your module
using the latest and greatest 3rd party tools. 
Even if you do not have tests, you can use <a href="http://next-update.herokuapp.com/">next-update-stats</a> service
to check overall module upgrade success statistics (collected anonymously).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/dont-break">dont-break</a> allows to check if your library would break projects that depend on it if you publish it as it is now.</li>
<li>A homebrew unit testing framework <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/gt">gt</a> that follows QUnit syntax but adds better async testing and code coverage (via <a href="https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul">istanbul</a>).
  There is a<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-gt">grunt-gt</a> to run GT as a grunt task.
</li>
<li>There is static source complexity tool <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/js-complexity-viz">jsc</a> that keeps my code nice and understandable</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lasso">lasso</a> to instrument widget test pages on the fly, giving you insight into the code covered for by the unit tests. There is no setup necessary, and check out the list of unit test frameworks in the examples folder: everything just works!</li>
<li>When the number of tests grows, and you cannot wait to run them all on each code change, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/untested">untested</a>. It stores test point mappings for each JavaScript source file (generated from code coverage reported by <em>gt</em> and <em>lasso</em>), and returns which unit tests should be run for all changed files. Test your changes all the time very quickly!</li>
<li>Well documented modules with lots of API examples are easier to reuse, maintain and develop.
I wrote js API documentation tool <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/xplain">xplain</a> that takes an unusual approach of placing unit tests as examples in the API documentation. The specific test syntax is transformed into human readable format, producing documentation that looks hand-crafted, will always stay in sync with the code, and does not require any developer maintenance.
  I wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-xplain">grunt-xplain</a> wrapper.
</li>
<li>I automate basic sanity check for any website deployment using <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/clean-console">clean-console</a>. It loads the url using phantomjs WebKit browser and checks for any JavaScript errors. This is quick test that runs as a last step of the deployment script.
  There is <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-clean-console">grunt-clean-console</a> plugin for grunt.
</li>
<li><a href="http://glebbahmutov.com/risk-map/">risk-map</a> is a cool way to visualize the entire project's code
  complexity and unit test coverage using D3 treemap layout. Shows high risk source files in a very obvious way as
  large red patches. I talk about my inspiration for the project in
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bahmutov/talks-public/raw/master/risk-map.md">this talk</a>. I am currently working
  on using <em>risk-map</em> and developer's vanity to improve software quality, see <a href="/man-behind">man-behind</a>
  prototype.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-promises">qunit-promises</a> is a QUnit plugin that makes checking promises a breeze.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-once">qunit-once</a> is a QUnit plugin adding module.setupOnce and module.teardownOnce functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-inject">qunit-inject</a> is a QUnit plugin for injecting variables from the module into unit tests by name.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-helpful">qunit-helpful</a> is a QUnit plugin for automatically providing the entire failed expression. Magical.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-utils">npm-utils</a> is a set of promise-returning functions that run different NPM commands.</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/jshint-solid">jshint-solid</a> tells how strict your .jshintrc file is. As project matures, you should tighten the Jshint settings.
There is <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-jshint-solid">grunt-jshint-solid</a> plugin for grunt.
</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/time-promise">time-promise</a> is a functional decorator measuring time for sync or promise-returning functions.
It is among my <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/my-favorite-functional-adaptors.html">four favorite functional adaptors</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud">proud</a> collects NPM downloads for all modules authored by a developer with given username.
  One can generate a <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud-badge">proud-badge</a>, even host a simple
  <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/proud-connect">proud-connect</a> server or use the deployed Heroku
  <a href="http://proud.herokuapp.com/">proud.herokuapp.com</a> app.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/aged">aged</a> is tiny utility grunt helper for filtering 
files by last modified age. Allows to define separate sets of quality metrics for recently modified (fresh)
and stable files. Read why I think this is important in 
<a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/aged-to-perfection.html">Aged to Perfection</a> blog post.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/es6-generators-example">es6-generators-example</a> shows how to
  write EcmaScript6 code with generators and make them available to everyone, even to people who use EcmaScript5 on node.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/dotdot">dotdot</a> installs a hook into Node loader and allows you
  to write shorthand <code>foo..bar('something')</code> instead of <code>foo.bar.bind(foo, 'something')</code>.
  You can also write <code>fn..('args')</code> instead of <code>fn.bind(null, 'args')</code>
  To make it compatible with build tools, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/gulp-dotdot">gulp-dotdot</a>
  that transforms `..` notation in the stream.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/node-hook">node-hook</a> is a simple way to hook into
  Node loader to transform the source before compiling it. There are multiple ways this is 
  <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/hooking-into-node-loader-for-fun-and-profit.html">super useful</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/connect-slow">connect-slow</a> is middleware for node Connect and Express
  servers. Allows to selectively delay serving some requests using URL RegExp. Used to polish user experience as
  described in <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/give-browser-a-chance.html">give browser a chance</a>.
  I wrote same feature for <a href="http://koajs.com/">Koa</a> server using generators, see <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/koa-slow">koa-slow</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/console.json">console.json</a> removes need to write 
<code>console.log(JSON.stringify(object, null, 2));</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/console.html">console.html</a> beautifies and prints HTML code or HTMLNode
<code>console.html($('#id'));</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/console.table">console.table</a> adds a method to print array of objects
  as nice table in Node.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/status-gravatar">status-gravatar</a> changes your Gravatar profile
  image depending on the Travis-ci build status of your projects. Sometimes I look angry when my projects start to fail ;)
  Uses my <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/set-gravatar">set-gravatar</a> module for Node.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-help">grunt-help</a> runs given command, captures output and saves
to given file. Useful to include the program`s <code>--help</code> output directly in the README.md.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/iframeable">iframeable</a> is tiny CLI to check if given website could be iframed
  inside another website (and is susceptible to clickjacking attack).
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-filenames">grunt-filenames</a> is a grunt plugin to validate source filenames,
  for example require all filenames to be lower cased with dashes.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/grunt-blank">grunt-blank</a> finds all empty, blank or small files.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/console-pop">console-pop</a> buffers calls to <code>console.log</code> and then
  returns a copy, useful for higher level testing.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/bare-objects">bare-objects</a> adds <code>&lt;&gt;</code> syntax to JavaScript
  via nodejs loader hook. Why? Because bare objects are <a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/sweet-naked-objects.html">sweet!</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lcov-filter">lcov-filter</a> filters coverage info for some files, useful

There is also <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/pre-commit-make-parallel">pre-commit-make-parallel</a> to run make with parallel tasks.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lazy-ass">lazy-ass</a> is a lazy assertion function for node and browser.
  Do not pay a performance penalty if the condition is false.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lazy-ass-helpful">lazy-ass-helpful</a> rewrites any function that uses <code>lazyAss</code>
on the fly putting the condition expression into the message. Super useful for unit testing because you can skip writing
extra messages in each assertion.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/lazy-test">lazy-test</a> turns testing inside out. You inject small testing
  framework and run the unit tests in production. Makes quick testing of code private to a closure possible, built on

    website color tweaking.
    Allows anyone to change multiple page colors, including swapping an entire external palette. I created
    <em>color-pusher</em> to give graphic designers power to tweak live websites without making a round trip to
    a developer to deploy the new color scheme. There is a Chrome DevTools 
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-pusher/gcahnlgconcbplfboahcgaobkpdhidee">panel extension</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/color-pusher-chrome">source</a>, that allows editing any live website.

</ul>

<h3 id="yesterday">Yesterday</h3>

<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.utest.com/">uTest</a> for half a year, mostly bringing together and updating various front end technology stacks.</p>

<p>I worked for a year at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a>, helping to bring the power of MATLAB to the browser.</p>

<p>Earlier I spent four years as a researcher at <a href="http://www.everyscape.com/">EveryScape</a>, writing panorama stitching and 3D modeling software. Before that I worked calibrating 3D laser scanners and developing white light scanners. Even before that I wrote distributed database access software that worked across Objective-C, C and Java systems.</p>

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p>I am a member of multiple meetups in the Boston area and spoke about
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/grunt.md">grunt</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/coverage-and-tests.md">code coverage and testing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/risk-map.md">technical debt visualization</a>,

  dependencies</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/talks/blob/master/agile-software-quality.md">agile software quality</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>Doctorate from Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana) working with Dr. Voice Popescu (adviser) and Dr. Mihai Mudure (fellow candidate), developing a novel scanning sensor. We were building 3D models of rooms in real time using a video camera and a bunch of lasers. If you were afraid of lasers, you could be anywhere else in the world, observing the results over the internet, as our system was smart enough to incrementally update the 3D model and send the results in real time.</p>
