{"name":"Dr. Gleb Bahmutov, PhD","tagline":"JavaScript ninja, image processing expert, software quality fanatic","body":"### Today\r\n\r\nI am a software engineer interested in front and back end development, especially in using JavaScript (and its flavors) across the entire stack. I work at MathWorks, helping to bring the power of MATLAB to your browser.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time I invented multiple open source tools to improve the software quality.\r\n* There is my unit testing framework [gt](https://github.com/bahmutov/gt) that follows QUnit syntax but adds better async testing and code coverage (via [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)).\r\n* There is static source complexity tool [jsc](https://github.com/bahmutov/js-complexity-viz) that keeps my code nice and understandable\r\n* I wrote [lasso](https://github.com/bahmutov/lasso) to instrument widget test pages on the fly, giving you insight into the code covered for by the unit tests. There is no setup necessary, and check out the list of unit test frameworks in the examples folder: everything just works!\r\n* When the number of tests grows, and you cannot wait to run them all on each code change, take a look at [untested](https://github.com/bahmutov/untested). It stores test point mappings for each JavaScript source file (generated from code coverage reported by *gt* and *lasso*), and returns which unit tests should be run for all changed files. Test your changes all the time very quickly!\r\n* Well documented modules with lots of API examples are easier to reuse, maintain and develop. I wrote js API documentation tool [xplain](https://github.com/bahmutov/xplain) that takes an unusual approach of placing unit tests as examples in the API documentation. The specific test syntax is transformed into human readable format, producing documentation that looks hand-crafted, will always stay in sync with the code, and does not require any developer maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Yesterday\r\n\r\nI worked for four years as a researcher at [EveryScape](http://www.everyscape.com/), writing panorama stitching and 3D modeling software. Before that I worked calibrating 3D laser scanners and developing white light scanners. Even before that I wrote distributed database access software that worked across Objective-C, C and Java systems.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\nDoctorate from Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana) working with Dr. Voice Popescu (adviser) and Dr. Mihai Mudure (fellow candidate), developing a novel scanning sensor. We were building 3D models of rooms in real time using a video camera and a bunch of lasers. If you were afraid of lasers, you could be anywhere else in the world, observing the results over the internet, as our system was smart enough to incrementally update the 3D model and send the results in real time.\r\n\r\n### Small print\r\n\r\nSome of my github repositories are not up to date, while my employer tries to develop a consistent open source policy.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
